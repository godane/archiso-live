 versions packaged separate
----------------------------
 17
  MOVED the ArchLinux specific scripts from package fbspash
		to package iniscripts-extras-fbsplash
	Advantages:
	- we don't need to build fbsplash itself again every time
	  the scripts are updated
	- people not liking some features gain more flexibility
	- we are able to have different packages providing fbsplash
	- we are able to use fbsplash without installing the scripts
	  (uswsusp-fbsplash only for example)
  CHANGED	fbsplash.inithooks
		splash-functions-arch.sh
		  to be able to take over the tmpfs and daemon from
		  fbsplash-1.5.4.3-11 and reuse a already running
		  daemon on shutdown
		PKGBUILD
		fbsplash.install
		  adapted for overriding scripts from fbsplash
 18
  CHANGED	fbsplash.conf
		splash-functions-arch.sh
		  added ability to keep the daemon and repaint the
		   splash instead of exiting on boot to avoid
		   getting lost on blackscreen
		  added new config option SPLASH_KEEP_SPLASH
		  changed STAY_SILENT out of the box setting to "yes"
		  don't try to exit the daemon on shutdown
		  improved overriding of old scripts
 19
  CHANGED	fbsplash.inithooks
		splash-functions-arch.sh
		  removed the overriding hacks
  CHANGED 	PKGBUILD
		  install all stuff now, using the normal pathnames
		  don't depend on fbsplash=1.5.4.3-11
		   (will have file conflicts anyway if not compatible)
  RENAMED	fbsplash.install to initscripts-extras-fbsplash.install
 20
		set SPLASH_KEEP_SPLASH="no" by default as it may break
		 things together with fbsplash-uswsusp
		don't do any splash stuff on runlevel changes
		stop any daemon kept or left over at boot
		 when calling daemon script with "kill"
		don't start splash if system was started into runlevel 1
		show a text message instead of leaving the screen empty
 21
		Renamed /etc/conf.d/fbsplash.conf to /etc/conf.d/fbsplash
 22
